## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker (Recommended for easiest setup)
- PostgreSQL (if not using Docker)

### Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  (If not using Docker) Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible. You may need to configure database connection details in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
3.  Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or `mvn spring-boot:run` on Windows if mvnw script isn't set up for cmd).
4.  Backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2.  Run `npm install`.
3.  Run `npm start`.
4.  Frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Docker Setup (Recommended)
1.  Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2.  From the project root directory:
    ```bash
    docker-compose build # (Optional, if you've made changes to Dockerfiles)
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This will build and start both the backend and frontend services, along with a PostgreSQL database instance.
